## Project Description

This project is the final lab project for the Data Structures course. It involves the implementation and performance analysis of various sorting algorithms. The project compares different sorting techniques based on their execution time and the number of comparisons made during the sorting process.

## Sorting Algorithms Implemented

Algorithm      | Time Complexity (Best) | Time Complexity (Average) | Time Complexity (Worst) | Space Complexity
---------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------
Bubble Sort    | O(n)                    | O(n^2)                    | O(n^2)                  | O(1)
Selection Sort | O(n^2)                  | O(n^2)                    | O(n^2)                  | O(1)
Insertion Sort | O(n)                    | O(n^2)                    | O(n^2)                  | O(1)
Merge Sort     | O(n log n)              | O(n log n)                | O(n log n)              | O(n)
Quick Sort     | O(n log n)              | O(n log n)                | O(n^2)                  | O(log n)
Heap Sort      | O(n log n)              | O(n log n)                | O(n log n)              | O(1)

## Features

- Menu-Driven Interface: Provides a user-friendly menu to select the sorting algorithm and input data.
- Performance Measurement: Measures and displays the execution time and number of comparisons for each sorting algorithm.
- Date and Time Display: Shows the current date and time.
